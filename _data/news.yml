  (https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2022.254) in the Zoological Research, \
  natural strabismus and amblyopia are accompanied by abnormal asymmetries of the visual system, especially visual neurophysiological and neurostructural defects. \
  Their results suggested that future therapeutic and mechanistic studies should consider defects and asymmetries throughout the entire visual system."

  entitled [Identification of visual cortex cell types and species differences \
  using single-cell RNA sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34590-1) \
  in the Nature Communications, they established a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 133,454 macaque visual cortical cells. \
It covers major cortical cell classes including 25 excitatory neuron types, 37 inhibitory neuron types and all glial cell types. \
The comparisons not only identified layer-specific markers, two crucial  neuron cell types, \
but also revealed that glutamatergic neurons may be more diverse across species than GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. \
These findings pave the way for understanding how the primary cortex fulfills the high-cognitive functions."
