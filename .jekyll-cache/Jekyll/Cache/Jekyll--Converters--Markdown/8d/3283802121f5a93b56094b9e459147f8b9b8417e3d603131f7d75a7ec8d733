I"­<p>Recently, Prof.Zhichao Miao, Prof.Amjad Khan, and Prof.Muhammad Khisroon collaborated on an article entitled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38088234/">Exome sequencing identifies homozygous variants in MBOAT7 associated with neurodevelopmental disorder</a> in the Clinical Genetics. They dentified three novel homozygous missense variants (NM_024298.5: c.588G &gt; T; p.Trp196Cys, c.736 T &gt; C; p.Tyr246His and c.524A &gt; C; p. Asp175Ala) and one rare homozygous in-frame deletion variant (c.758_778del;p.Glu253_Ala259del) in membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family member 7 (MBOAT7) gene previously associated with autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>
