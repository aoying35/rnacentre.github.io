I"C<p>Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao and Prof.Sheng Liu co-published an article entitled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34590-1">Identification of visual cortex cell types and species differences using single-cell RNA sequencing</a> in the Nature Communications, they established a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 133,454 macaque visual cortical cells. It covers major cortical cell classes including 25 excitatory neuron types, 37 inhibitory neuron types and all glial cell types. The comparisons not only identified layer-specific markers, two crucial  neuron cell types, but also revealed that glutamatergic neurons may be more diverse across species than GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. These findings pave the way for understanding how the primary cortex fulfills the high-cognitive functions.</p>
