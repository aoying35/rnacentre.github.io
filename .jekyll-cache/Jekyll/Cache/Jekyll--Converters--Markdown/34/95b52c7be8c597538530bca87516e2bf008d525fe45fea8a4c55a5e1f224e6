I"w<p>Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao and Prof.Xinwen Chen collaborated on an article<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36840407/">Sterile 20-like kinase 3 promotes tick-borne encephalitis virus assembly by interacting with NS2A and prM and enhancing the NS2A-NS4A association</a> in the Journal of Medical virology, they found that MST3 interacts with the viral proteins NS2A and prM; and MST3 enhances the interaction of NS2A–NS4A.Thus, MST3-NS2A complex plays a major role in recruiting prM–E heterodimers and NS4A and mediates the virion assembly. Additionally, we found that MST3 was biotinylated and combined with other proteins (e.g., ATG5, Sec24A, and SNX4) that are associated with the cellular membrane required for TBEV infection. Overall, their study revealed a novel function for MST3 in TBEV infection and identified as a novel host factor supporting TBEV assembly</p>
