I"Ì<p>Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao and Prof.Zhaoming Su collaborated on an article entitled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36828938/">Structural basis of sRNA RsmZ regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence</a> in the Cell Research, an intercellular communication network based on cell density, quorum sensing (QS), regulates numerous gene expressions including those related to both acute and chronic virulence of P. aeruginosa. The global regulatory protein of the repressor of secondary metabolites (Rsm) system in bacteria, RsmA, is found to predominantly regulate these virulence entities in P. aeruginosa by modulating related gene expressions at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.</p>
