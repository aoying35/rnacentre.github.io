I"*<p>Recently, Prof. Zhichao Miao and Prof.Jules A Hoffmann collaborated on an article entitled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36996781/">Single Cell Analysis of the Fate of Injected Oncogenic RasV12 Cells in Adult Wild Type Drosophila</a> in the Journal of innate immunity, They have injected dish-cultured oncogenic RasV12 cells into adult male flies and analyzed by single cell transcriptomics their destiny within the host after 11 days.They identified in the preinjection samples and in the 11-day postinjection samples in all 16 clusters of cells, of which 5 disappeared during the experiment in the host,and they hypothesize that this results from a bitter dialogue between the injected cells and the host, while the experiments presented here should contribute to deciphering this dialogue</p>
