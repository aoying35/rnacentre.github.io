Additionally, we found that MST3 was biotinylated and combined with other proteins (e.g., ATG5, Sec24A, and SNX4) that are associated with the cellular membrane required for TBEV infection. Overall, their study revealed a novel function for MST3 in TBEV infection and identified as a novel host factor supporting TBEV assembly</em></p>

It covers major cortical cell classes including 25 excitatory neuron types, 37 inhibitory neuron types and all glial cell types. The comparisons not only identified layer-specific markers, two crucial  neuron cell types, but also revealed that glutamatergic neurons may be more diverse across species than GABAergic neurons and non-neuronal cells. These findings pave the way for understanding how the primary cortex fulfills the high-cognitive functions.</em></p>
