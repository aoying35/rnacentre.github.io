I"<p>Recently, Prof.Zhichao Miao, Prof.Jie Zha, and Prof.Yong Yu collaborated on an article entitled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10576290/">Nr4a1 marks a distinctive ILC2 activation subset in the mouse inflammatory lung</a> in the BMC Biology. Their findings showed that activated ILC2s are a heterogenous population encompassing distinct subsets that have different propensities, and therefore provide an opportunity to explore PD-1â€™s role in modulating the activity of ILC2s for disease prevention and therapy.</p>
